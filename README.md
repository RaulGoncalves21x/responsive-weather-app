# Responsive Weather App

The purpose of this project is to conceive a React application, developed from scratch, using TypeScript. Through its development, I aspire to enrich my knowledge related to the React library and its various concepts, as well as the implementation of external APIs. It is my intention for this application to have a minimalistic and modern interface, while being responsive and adapting appropriately to the various sizes of devices on which it can be accessed.

As stated previously, the primary objective of this project is to serve as a means to further refine and bolster my existing skills and knowledge. It is important to clarify that this project is not intended for use within any professional setting; rather, its sole purpose is to contribute to the gradual development of my portfolio.
